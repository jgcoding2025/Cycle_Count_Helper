1. GROUPING
    a. A “group” is one unique item (across all warehouses/locations).
    b. ST01 is treated as its own location row in the group, but it is excluded from secondary variance math.
2. LOCATION CLASSES
    a. Default: the item’s designated default location row.
    b. Secondary: every location row that is not default and not ST01.
    c. ST01: special holding location; excluded from secondary variance calculation.
3. ST01 STATES
    a. Unsecured: inventory offlined in the system that may still physically be in default (timing/process).
    b. Secured: inventory that has been physically pulled and is in ST01.
4. ST01 REFERENCES
    a. ST01 is never physically counted; assume it is correct.
    b. ST01 may only be referenced when ST01 system qty <> 0
    c. If ST01 = 0, the system must not suggest checking ST01 or use ST01 in any reasoning.
5. EXPECTED PHYSICAL RANGE (for tolerance only)
    (Used only to compute default_outside_tolerance_qty when ST01 logic is eligible.)
    a. expected_physical_min = default_system
    b. expected_physical_max = default_system + ST01
6. Definitions
    a. “exists an Available / Available upon request secondary with excess stock”:
        Within the item group, at least one Secondary row (non-default, non-ST01) has Allocation Category = Available or Available upon request and (count − system) > 0
